# sql_queries_colab

## 📄 Overview  
```
sql_queries_colab is a collection of SQL-based data-analysis notebooks using Google Colab.  
It leverages the `%sql` magic (via an appropriate SQL extension) and Python (with pandas, os, matplotlib, etc.)
to import, query, and visualize data — making it easy to analyze datasets directly in Colab without setting up a local database.  

The project demonstrates a variety of SQL query techniques, from basic aggregations and filtering, to more advanced window,
date/time, and conditional queries, wrapped in Python for data parsing and visualization.

## ✨ Features & What’s Included With The Link to the Queries attached below  

**Example notebooks applying basic SQL aggregations: `COUNT`, `SUM`, `DISTINCT`, etc.**
-  https://github.com/dareoyeleke/sql_queries_colab/blob/main/BASIC_AGGREGATION_COUNT%2C_SUM%2C_DISTINCT.ipynb
  
**Use of statistical aggregation functions: `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `MEDIAN`.**  
-  https://github.com/dareoyeleke/sql_queries_colab/blob/main/STAT_AGGREGATION_AVG%2C_MIN%2C_MAX%2C_MED.ipynb

**Demonstrations of conditional logic within SQL (e.g. `CASE WHEN`) to build pivot-table–like summaries.**
-  https://github.com/dareoyeleke/sql_queries_colab/blob/main/ADVANCED_SEGMENTATION.ipynb

**Manipulation of date/time data: using `DATE_TRUNC`, `EXTRACT`, `TO_CHAR`, `INTERVAL`, `CURRENT_DATE`, etc.**
-  https://github.com/dareoyeleke/sql_queries_colab/blob/main/ADVANCED_SEGMENTATION.ipynb

- Integration with pandas + matplotlib for visualization / further data processing (after SQL queries).  
- Usage of a publicly available sample dataset (e.g. `Contoso100_k` retail dataset) to showcase real-world-style data analysis workflows.

## 🧰 Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
- A (free) Google account to run Google Colab notebooks.  
- No local database setup required — everything runs in Colab.  
- Basic familiarity with SQL and Python is helpful (but notebooks include explanations).
